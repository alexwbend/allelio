# What Is a Genetic Counselor? When and Why You Should See One

Imagine you've just received the results from a DNA test and discovered you carry a variant linked to a hereditary condition. Or perhaps you're planning to start a family and worry about your family's medical history. What happens next? For many people, the answer is to see a genetic counselor—a healthcare professional most people have never heard of, but who can be invaluable when genetics and health intersect.

## Who Are Genetic Counselors?

Genetic counselors are masters-level healthcare professionals trained in both human genetics and counseling. They typically hold a Master's degree in Genetic Counseling from an accredited program and must pass a certification exam through the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC). This dual training is key: they understand the science deeply, but they're also trained to communicate complex information in ways that matter to your life and your values.

A genetic counselor's job is to help you understand your genetic risks, explore what those risks mean for you and your family, and make informed decisions. They don't diagnose disease or prescribe treatment—that's the doctor's role. Instead, they translate the language of genetics into clarity and help you decide what to do with information that can feel overwhelming.

## How Genetic Counselors Differ from Doctors and Geneticists

It's easy to confuse genetic counselors with other healthcare providers, so let's clarify:

**Doctors (Primary Care Physicians)** manage your overall health and can refer you to specialists. They know medicine broadly but may not specialize in genetics. They're the ones who order tests and interpret results in the context of your whole health picture.

**Geneticists (Medical Geneticists)** are MDs or DOs with additional training in genetics. They diagnose genetic conditions, prescribe treatments, and manage medical care for people with genetic diseases. Some genetic counselors work alongside geneticists in clinics.

**Genetic Counselors** focus on education, risk assessment, and support. They spend more time with patients—often 30–60 minutes in an initial appointment—exploring family history, explaining test options, discussing what results might mean, and helping you process emotions alongside facts. Many insurance plans actually cover genetic counseling, recognizing its value.

## What to Expect at a Genetic Counseling Appointment

A typical genetic counseling session follows a thoughtful structure:

**Family History Review**: The counselor will ask detailed questions about your family—diseases, ages of diagnosis, causes of death. They may draw a pedigree (family tree) that helps identify patterns. This is often more informative than any DNA test.

**Education**: You'll learn about inheritance patterns, how genes work, and what specific tests can (and cannot) tell you. The counselor will explain the difference between a genetic predisposition and a guaranteed diagnosis.

**Risk Assessment**: Based on your history and genetics, the counselor will discuss your actual risk of developing or passing on a condition, often comparing it to population risk so you understand perspective.

**Test Discussion**: If appropriate, they'll explain what tests are available, what results might mean, and what happens next. They'll also discuss the emotional and social implications—something standard medical visits often miss.

**Support and Resources**: Genetic counselors connect you with community resources, support groups, and follow-up care. They're there to process difficult information with you.

## When Should You See a Genetic Counselor?

Consider genetic counseling in these situations:

**Before or After Consumer DNA Testing**: Many people take a 23andMe or AncestryDNA test and then wonder what the results mean, especially if something unexpected appears. A genetic counselor can help you interpret results in context.

**Strong Family History**: If multiple relatives have had cancer, heart disease, early dementia, or other serious conditions, a counselor can assess whether genetic testing is appropriate and help you understand what inherited risks you might carry.

**Pregnancy Planning**: If you or your partner have a family history of genetic conditions, or if you're over 35, genetic counseling can inform your prenatal screening choices.

**Cancer Risk Assessment**: If you've had certain cancers young, or have multiple relatives with cancer, you might be at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes (like BRCA mutations). A counselor helps determine whether genetic testing makes sense.

**Unexplained Medical Symptoms**: Sometimes a person has symptoms without a clear diagnosis. Genetic counseling can help explore whether a genetic condition might explain what's happening.

**After a Diagnosis**: If you or a family member have been diagnosed with a genetic condition, a counselor helps you understand what it means and what to tell relatives.

## How to Find a Genetic Counselor

The National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) maintains a "Find a Genetic Counselor" directory online. You can search by location, specialty, and insurance. Many genetic counselors also offer telehealth appointments, which dramatically expands access—you no longer need one in your city.

Your doctor can also refer you. If you have a known genetic condition in your family, your doctor may have a standing referral relationship with a counselor.

## Cost and Insurance Coverage

The cost of genetic counseling varies, but a typical initial appointment is $100–300. Many insurance plans cover genetic counseling, especially if ordered by your doctor. Check with your insurance or ask the counselor's office about payment options and sliding scale fees.

Telehealth visits are often more affordable and can remove transportation barriers. Some counselors work through community health centers or research programs where cost is reduced or waived.

## The Real Value

Genetic counseling is, at its core, about translating science into human terms. You might learn from Allelio or another tool that you carry a variant associated with something concerning. A genetic counselor helps you ask: What does this mean for me? What's my actual risk? What are my options? How do I talk to my family about this?

They provide something no algorithm can: the space to be confused, worried, or relieved—and to move through that into clarity and action.
