# BRCA, APOE, and Beyond: What High-Impact Genes in Your DNA Results Actually Mean

Some gene names carry weight that most people can feel even without a science background. BRCA has become synonymous with cancer risk since Angelina Jolie's widely publicized 2013 decision to undergo a preventive mastectomy after learning she carried a BRCA1 variant. APOE is increasingly recognized for its connection to Alzheimer's disease. TP53 is known in oncology as "the guardian of the genome."

If Allelio flags a variant in one of these genes, it will display a prominent warning. This article explains why these genes get special treatment, what the findings might mean, and — critically — what they don't mean.

## Why Certain Genes Are Flagged

Most genetic variants that consumer DNA tests pick up have small, statistical effects. A slight increase in coffee metabolism. A marginal association with height. Interesting, but not life-altering.

A small number of genes are different. Variants in these genes can have large effects on disease risk — sometimes dramatically so. They're called "high-impact" or "high-penetrance" genes because a single pathogenic variant in one of these genes can significantly change a person's likelihood of developing a serious condition.

Allelio flags variants in these genes with additional warnings not to alarm you, but to make sure you understand the stakes and seek appropriate professional guidance before drawing conclusions.

## BRCA1 and BRCA2: Hereditary Cancer Risk

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes. In their normal form, they produce proteins that help repair damaged DNA and prevent cells from growing uncontrollably. When a pathogenic variant disrupts one of these genes, the cell's ability to repair itself is compromised, significantly increasing the risk of certain cancers.

Women who carry a pathogenic BRCA1 variant have a lifetime breast cancer risk of approximately 55-72% (compared to about 13% in the general population) and an ovarian cancer risk of approximately 39-44% (compared to about 1.2%). BRCA2 pathogenic variants carry a breast cancer risk of about 45-69% and an ovarian cancer risk of about 11-17%. These genes also affect cancer risk in men, particularly for breast cancer and prostate cancer.

These numbers are averages from large studies. Individual risk depends on the specific variant, family history, and other factors. Not every pathogenic BRCA variant confers the same level of risk.

If Allelio identifies a variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2, two things are important. First, consumer genotyping chips test only a handful of the thousands of known BRCA variants. A result showing "no pathogenic BRCA variant found" does not mean you don't carry one — it means the specific variants on the chip weren't detected. Second, any BRCA finding from a consumer test should be confirmed through clinical-grade sequencing before any medical decisions are made.

## APOE: Alzheimer's Disease Risk

The APOE gene (apolipoprotein E) comes in three common forms: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. Your APOE type is determined by two SNPs — rs429358 and rs7412 — and you inherit one copy from each parent, giving you one of six possible combinations.

APOE3/APOE3 is the most common combination and represents average risk. APOE4 carriers have elevated risk: one copy of APOE4 increases Alzheimer's risk approximately 3-fold, and two copies increase it approximately 8-15-fold. APOE2 carriers have reduced risk.

Allelio gives APOE variants an extra warning because knowledge of APOE status has documented psychological effects. Studies have found that people who learn they carry APOE4 may experience lasting anxiety about cognitive decline, even when they are cognitively healthy. The Alzheimer's Association and many genetic counselors recommend that APOE testing be accompanied by professional pre- and post-test counseling.

It's also essential to know that APOE4 is a risk factor, not a diagnosis. The majority of APOE4 carriers never develop Alzheimer's disease. And many people who develop Alzheimer's don't carry APOE4. Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors play substantial roles.

## TP53: The Guardian of the Genome

TP53 produces the p53 protein, which is involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). When cells are damaged, p53 either pauses cell division to allow repairs or triggers cell death to prevent damaged cells from proliferating.

Pathogenic variants in TP53 are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a hereditary condition that dramatically increases the risk of multiple cancer types, often at young ages. Cancers associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome include breast cancer, bone cancers (osteosarcoma), soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, and adrenal cortical carcinoma, among others.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is rare, but when it occurs, the cancer risk is severe — estimated lifetime cancer risk approaches 90-100% for women and 70% for men. Families with TP53 pathogenic variants are typically managed with intensive cancer surveillance protocols.

## Lynch Syndrome Genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2

These four genes are part of the DNA mismatch repair system — a quality-control mechanism that fixes errors made during DNA replication. Pathogenic variants in any of these genes cause Lynch syndrome (formerly called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC).

Lynch syndrome significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer (up to 80% lifetime risk for some genes), endometrial cancer in women (up to 60%), and elevated risk for ovarian, stomach, urinary tract, brain, and other cancers.

Lynch syndrome is one of the most common hereditary cancer syndromes, estimated to affect about 1 in 279 people. Many carriers are unaware of their status. Early detection through increased surveillance (more frequent colonoscopies, for example) can dramatically improve outcomes.

## What to Do If Allelio Flags a High-Impact Gene

If you see a warning in your Allelio results for any of these genes, here's the most important thing to know: do not panic, and do not self-diagnose.

Consumer genotyping chips have known error rates, and findings from consumer tests should always be confirmed through clinical-grade testing ordered by a healthcare provider. A genetic counselor can evaluate your result in the context of your personal and family medical history, discuss what confirmatory testing involves, and help you understand your options.

The National Society of Genetic Counselors offers a directory at findageneticcounselor.nsgc.org where you can find a board-certified genetic counselor near you or through telehealth.

If a clinical test confirms a pathogenic variant in a high-impact gene, your medical team can develop a surveillance and management plan tailored to your situation. For many hereditary conditions, early detection and proactive management can make a dramatic difference in outcomes.

## What These Genes Don't Tell You

Even high-impact genes don't tell the full story. Cancer risk is influenced by environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, other genetic modifiers, and chance. A pathogenic variant is a significant piece of information, but it's one piece.

Similarly, not finding a pathogenic variant in these genes doesn't mean you're in the clear. Consumer chips test only a small number of the known variants in each gene. Comprehensive genetic evaluation requires clinical sequencing that covers the full gene, including deletions and rearrangements that chips can't detect.

Allelio flags these genes because the stakes are higher. But the core message is the same one that applies to every result in the tool: this is educational information, not a diagnosis. The right professional can help you turn information into understanding, and understanding into action.
