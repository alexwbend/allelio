# Mendelian vs. Complex Diseases: Why Some Conditions Are Easier to Predict Than Others

If you've spent time reading about genetics—or looking at your own DNA results—you've probably come across terms like "single-gene disorder" or "multifactorial disease." But what do these terms actually mean, and why should you care? The answer matters because it shapes what tools like Allelio can realistically tell you about your health.

Some genetic conditions are straightforward: you inherit a mutation in one gene, and the disease follows. Others are messier—caused by the combined effect of dozens of genes plus your environment and lifestyle. Understanding the difference helps you interpret your results with appropriate skepticism and hope.

## Mendelian Diseases: The Straightforward Cases

Mendelian diseases are named after Gregor Mendel, the 19th-century monk who discovered the rules of heredity by watching pea plants. These are conditions caused by a mutation in a single gene. If you inherit that mutation, you'll typically develop the condition—or you won't, if you don't carry it. Simple, predictable, clear.

**Cystic Fibrosis** is a classic example. It's caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. If you inherit two mutated copies (one from each parent), you'll develop cystic fibrosis. If you inherit one mutated copy, you're a carrier but won't develop the disease. This follows Mendel's rules with almost mathematical precision.

**Huntington's Disease** is another: a single dominant mutation is enough to cause the disease. If you carry it, you'll develop symptoms—usually in midlife, and inevitably as you age. There's almost no ambiguity.

**Sickle Cell Disease**, **Hemophilia**, **Marfan Syndrome**, and **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy** are similarly Mendelian. In each case, the inheritance pattern is clear, the genetic cause is well-understood, and if you have the mutation, your health trajectory is largely determined.

This is why consumer DNA tests and tools like Allelio can be quite accurate for Mendelian conditions. The logic is straightforward: check for the known mutation, and if it's there, the person likely carries the disease risk.

## Complex or Multifactorial Diseases: The Fuzzy Cases

Most common diseases—the ones that affect millions of people and kill most of us eventually—don't work this way. They're **multifactorial**, meaning many genes contribute, plus environmental factors like diet, exercise, stress, pollution, and luck all play a role.

**Type 2 Diabetes** involves mutations in hundreds of different genes, each contributing a tiny bit of risk. Add in diet, weight, physical activity, and sleep patterns, and you have a complex picture. Two people with identical genetic risk profiles might have completely different outcomes depending on how they live.

**Heart Disease** similarly involves numerous genetic factors, but your cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, stress, exercise, family relationships, and socioeconomic circumstances also matter enormously.

**Most Cancers** arise from a combination of inherited genetic factors, acquired mutations (mutations that happen during your lifetime in your cells), and environmental exposures. A woman with a BRCA mutation has a much higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but she won't necessarily develop cancer, and a woman without the mutation can still get cancer.

**Alzheimer's Disease** shows this pattern too. Carrying the APOE4 gene variant increases risk, but many people with it live into old age without developing Alzheimer's. Others without the variant still develop the disease.

## Why Consumer DNA Tests Are Better at Detecting Mendelian Risks

Consumer DNA tests work with what's called a "SNP chip"—a device that looks at roughly one million common genetic variants across your genome. This technology works beautifully for Mendelian conditions because the causal mutations are usually well-known, and the SNP chip either detects them directly or detects them indirectly (through nearby variants that are usually inherited together).

For complex diseases, SNP chips can estimate genetic risk by summing up the small effects of hundreds of variants, but these estimates are rough. They rank you relative to other people in your population but can't predict whether you'll actually get sick. You might have high genetic risk but excellent lifestyle factors. You might have low genetic risk but develop the disease anyway due to bad luck or environment.

This is why Allelio, and other consumer genomics tools, can give you reasonably reliable information about Mendelian risks but much hazier information about complex disease risk. Both types of results have value, but they require different interpretations.

## The Missing Heritability Problem

Here's something that might surprise you: even for complex diseases where we understand that genetics play a major role, we can only explain a fraction of the genetic risk using known variants.

If we know that diabetes has 50% heritability—meaning genes account for about half the variation in who gets it—we should be able to predict risk from DNA variants. But typically, we can only explain maybe 10% of that genetic heritability. The rest is "missing."

Where is it? Scientists have several theories:

- **Rare variants**: Most of our DNA databases focus on common variants. Rare mutations might carry large effects but are scattered across the population.
- **Gene-environment interactions**: A variant might increase risk only when combined with a specific environment. Detecting these interactions requires data we usually don't have.
- **Epigenetic effects**: Changes in how genes are expressed, not changes in the DNA sequence itself, might play a role.
- **Structural variants**: Large chunks of DNA deleted or duplicated might matter more than single-letter changes, but we detect them less often.
- **Genetic complexity**: Interactions between genes might be more important than individual gene effects.

This "missing heritability" is humbling. It means that even as our genetic knowledge expands, we should be cautious about claims that DNA testing alone can predict health outcomes.

## What This Means for Your Allelio Results

When you use Allelio or a similar tool to analyze your raw DNA data, keep this distinction in mind:

**For Mendelian conditions**: The results are relatively reliable. If you carry a known pathogenic mutation for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, or Huntington's, that's information worth taking seriously and discussing with a genetic counselor or doctor.

**For complex disease risk**: The results are informative but limited. A genetic risk score that ranks you as high-risk for diabetes tells you something—but it's not destiny. Lifestyle factors matter. Many low-risk people develop disease. Many high-risk people stay healthy.

The tool is most valuable as a conversation starter. If Allelio shows you carry high genetic risk for a condition, that's a reason to talk to your doctor, modify lifestyle factors, or screen more carefully. It's not a diagnosis, and it's not certainty.

## Moving Forward with Clarity

Understanding the difference between Mendelian and complex diseases helps you be a better interpreter of your own genetic information. It keeps you from over-interpreting results while still respecting what they can tell you. And it reminds you that genes are just one part of your health story—important, but never the whole story.
