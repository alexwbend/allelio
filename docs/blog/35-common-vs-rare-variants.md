# Common vs. Rare Variants: Why Frequency Matters in Genetics

When you look at your DNA results, you'll see thousands of variants — genetic differences between you and a reference sequence. But not all variants are created equal. Some are so common that they appear in half the global population. Others are so rare that only a handful of people on Earth carry them. Understanding the difference between common and rare variants is crucial to making sense of your genetic data and knowing which findings might actually matter to your health.

## What Is Allele Frequency and Why Does It Matter?

Allele frequency (often abbreviated as MAF when referring to "minor allele frequency") is simply a measure of how often a particular genetic variant appears in a population. If a variant is present in 1% of people, its frequency is 0.01. If it's in 50% of people, it's 0.5.

This seemingly simple statistic is surprisingly powerful. Frequency tells you something fundamental: whether a variant is ancient (common variants tend to be very old and have spread throughout populations) or recent (rare variants often arose within the last few thousand years). It also hints at whether a variant is likely to be harmful — if a devastating variant were common, our species probably wouldn't be here to study it.

Geneticists use allele frequency as one of the first filters when evaluating whether a variant matters. A variant that appears in 50% of healthy people is almost certainly not the cause of a rare genetic disease. But it might explain subtle differences in height, metabolism, or risk for a common disease like diabetes.

## Common Variants: The Ubiquitous Ones

Common variants are defined somewhat arbitrarily as those appearing in more than 1% of the population. In practice, most "common" variants that show up in consumer DNA tests are even more frequent — often appearing in 10%, 30%, 50% or higher.

Here's what matters about common variants:

**They usually have very small individual effects.** A common variant might increase your risk for Type 2 diabetes by 10% or 15%, but it doesn't guarantee you'll develop diabetes. You'd need many additional variants, plus environmental factors like diet and exercise, for a disease to actually develop.

**They're what geneticists call the "common disease, common variant" hypothesis.** This idea suggests that the genetic basis of common diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer involves many common variants, each contributing a tiny bit of risk. This theory explains why we inherited these genes — they usually help us, or at least aren't harmful enough to have been removed by evolution.

**Consumer DNA tests are heavily biased toward common variants.** Tests from 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and similar services use "SNP chips" that only test about 600,000 to 1 million pre-selected locations in your genome. These chips are designed around common variants that show clear patterns in large populations. They miss the vast majority of rare variants simply because rare variants are too scattered to include on a single chip.

This bias is important to understand: if you take a DNA test and don't see any genetic findings related to a disease you're concerned about, it doesn't mean you don't carry pathogenic variants for that condition — it just means the test didn't look for them.

## Rare Variants: The Powerful Ones

Rare variants (fewer than 1% frequency, sometimes defined even more strictly as 0.1% or 0.01%) tell a different story.

**Rare variants often have large, sometimes dramatic effects.** While common variants nudge your risk up or down by small amounts, a single rare variant can be the primary cause of a genetic disease. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and Huntington's disease are all caused by rare variants (though there can be multiple different rare variants that cause the same condition).

**Rare variants are newer, evolutionarily speaking.** They haven't had time to spread through populations because either they arose recently, or they've been kept rare by natural selection because they're often harmful.

**Each person carries thousands of rare variants.** Most of these are harmless — they're just variants that exist in the human population but happen to be uncommon. Some rare variants are benign. Some are unknown in terms of their effects. And a tiny minority are pathogenic — actually capable of causing disease.

**Rare pathogenic variants are often missed by consumer tests.** Because SNP chips are biased toward common variants, rare disease-causing variants often slip through undetected. This is why someone with a family history of a genetic condition might take a DNA test, see no relevant findings, and then get clinical whole-genome sequencing that reveals the culprit.

## Why Context Matters: The Same Variant Can Mean Different Things

A critical insight: whether a variant is important depends heavily on whether it's common or rare in your specific population group.

A variant might be common in people of East Asian ancestry but rare in people of European ancestry. The same genetic difference will have been filtered differently by evolution in different populations because different populations have different environmental pressures and different founding population genetics.

This is why genetic databases like gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database) now include frequency data broken down by ancestry group. A variant that appears in 5% of people with Finnish ancestry but 0.5% of people with African ancestry tells you something very different about its evolutionary history and potential health impact.

## What Allelio Shows You

Allelio pulls together variant data from ClinVar (which classifies variants as pathogenic, benign, or uncertain) and combines it with population frequency data. When you run your DNA data through Allelio, you'll see variants flagged based on several criteria, including frequency.

A rare variant flagged in ClinVar as "likely pathogenic" is concerning because it's both rare (unlikely to be a normal human polymorphism) and potentially harmful (classified by clinical evidence). A common variant in a gene might show up, but Allelio will help you understand that its effect size is probably small.

This is why interpreting your results responsibly means always asking: "How common is this variant? And in which populations?"

## The Bottom Line

The distinction between common and rare variants represents one of the most important concepts in modern genetics. Common variants explain why healthy traits and disease risks are distributed across populations — they're part of normal human variation. Rare variants are the real danger spots, the places where a single change in your DNA might actually affect your health.

When you encounter a genetic finding, whether from Allelio or any other tool, one of your first questions should be: "How common is this variant?" The answer will shape how seriously you take the result and what you do with the information.
