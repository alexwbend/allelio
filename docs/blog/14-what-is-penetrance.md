# What Is Penetrance? Why Having a "Pathogenic" Variant Doesn't Mean You'll Get Sick

You're reading your Allelio results and you find a pathogenic variant in your data. Your first reaction might be alarm: "I have a disease-causing variant—does this mean I'm going to get sick?" The answer is often no, and understanding why requires learning about a concept called **penetrance**.

Penetrance is one of the most important ideas in medical genetics, and it's crucial for interpreting genetic results wisely. It explains why having a pathogenic variant is not the same as having a disease.

## What Penetrance Really Means

**Penetrance** is the probability that someone carrying a particular genetic variant will actually show the disease or trait associated with that variant.

If a variant has 100% penetrance, then everyone who carries it will develop the condition. If it has 70% penetrance, then only about 70% of people who carry the variant will develop the condition. The other 30% might carry the variant their entire lives without ever becoming ill.

Let's use a concrete example: the BRCA1 gene and breast cancer. A pathogenic BRCA1 variant increases breast cancer risk and is labeled "pathogenic" in the medical literature. But BRCA1 doesn't have 100% penetrance for breast cancer. People with a BRCA1 mutation have roughly a 70% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.

This means: **30% of people with a pathogenic BRCA1 variant never develop breast cancer.** They carry the "disease-causing" variant but never get sick. And the 70% who do develop cancer might develop it at age 35, or at age 65, or anywhere in between.

## Complete vs. Incomplete Penetrance

**Complete penetrance** (100% penetrance) means the variant virtually always causes the associated condition. These are rare but do exist. Some forms of Huntington's disease have nearly complete penetrance—if you carry the mutation, you will almost certainly develop the disease eventually (though age of onset varies).

**Incomplete penetrance** is much more common. Most pathogenic variants don't affect everyone who carries them. This is why you can carry a "disease gene" and never get sick.

## Real-World Examples Across Different Conditions

Let's look at several real variants and their penetrance to make this concrete:

### BRCA1/BRCA2 and Breast Cancer
As mentioned, about 70% penetrance for breast cancer in women. But here's more complexity: penetrance varies by age. By age 40, the risk is maybe 10-15%, but by age 70 it's much higher. Also, penetrance can differ between BRCA1 and BRCA2, and even between different mutations within the same gene.

### Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) and Alzheimer's Disease
APOE4 is actually not a rare pathogenic variant—it's fairly common (about 15-25% of people carry one copy). People with one copy of APOE4 have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, and those with two copies have even higher risk. But incomplete penetrance is huge here: many people with two copies of APOE4 live into their 90s without developing Alzheimer's.

### Huntingtin (HTT) and Huntington's Disease
Huntington's disease has much higher penetrance than BRCA or APOE4. Almost everyone who carries a pathogenic HTT expansion will develop the disease eventually—though the age of onset varies. This is closer to complete penetrance.

### Cystic Fibrosis (CFTR)
For cystic fibrosis, penetrance is very high in people with two pathogenic copies (homozygous), but people with just one copy (heterozygous carriers) typically have no symptoms at all.

## Why Does Penetrance Vary?

Why don't pathogenic variants always cause disease? The reasons are complex and interrelated:

### Genetic Modifiers
Your other genes matter. Someone might carry a pathogenic variant in one gene but have protective variants in other genes that compensate or mitigate the effect. These are called **genetic modifiers**.

### Environmental Factors
Many genetic conditions have environmental components. Someone might carry a pathogenic variant but never develop the disease because they avoid the relevant environmental exposure, or because they have protective lifestyle factors. For example, someone with a variant predisposing to lung cancer might not develop it if they never smoke.

### Epigenetics
Gene expression—whether a gene is turned up or turned down—can vary. Two people with the identical pathogenic variant might have different disease outcomes if one person's cell expresses that gene more highly than the other's. This is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms (chemical modifications to DNA that affect how genes are read).

### Random Chance
Sometimes biology is just random. The cellular processes that determine whether a variant causes trouble are probabilistic. Penetrance reflects that randomness.

## Expressivity vs. Penetrance: Don't Confuse Them

These terms are often mixed up, so let's be clear:

- **Penetrance** is about whether you get the disease at all (yes or no).
- **Expressivity** is about how severe the disease is if you do get it.

You can have high penetrance but low expressivity (everyone with the variant gets sick, but they get a mild version). Or incomplete penetrance with high expressivity (some people with the variant get very sick, while others don't get sick at all).

For example, someone with a cystic fibrosis mutation might have high penetrance (they definitely have CF) but low expressivity (their symptoms are relatively mild). Someone else with the same mutation might have the same penetrance but high expressivity (severe symptoms).

## Why Penetrance Matters for Allelio Results

When Allelio flags a pathogenic variant, it's important to understand that "pathogenic" means "this variant has been associated with disease in some people." It doesn't mean you have the disease, or that you definitely will.

Ideally, Allelio would tell you the penetrance of each variant it identifies, but for many variants, especially rarer ones, penetrance isn't precisely known. Researchers might know it's incomplete, but they can't put an exact number on it.

This is where working with a genetic counselor becomes valuable. They can discuss your specific variant, your family history, and your ancestry—all factors that influence how relevant that variant is to you personally.

## The Reassurance and the Caution

Here's the reassuring part: carrying a pathogenic variant doesn't mean you have a disease. Many people live long healthy lives with pathogenic variants, sometimes never realizing they carry them.

Here's the cautious part: incomplete penetrance doesn't mean zero risk. If a variant is associated with a serious condition, you should take that seriously—monitor your health, discuss screening options with your doctor, and make informed decisions about your lifestyle and family planning.

The key is balanced interpretation. Pathogenic variants matter, but they're not destiny.

## Moving Forward with This Knowledge

If Allelio identifies a pathogenic variant in your results, don't panic—but do take it seriously enough to learn more. Talk to your doctor or a genetic counselor. Ask about:

- The penetrance of your specific variant (if known)
- Your family history and how it influences your risk
- Screening options (if any exist)
- Preventive measures you might take
- Whether the finding has implications for your relatives

Understanding penetrance empowers you to interpret genetic information wisely—neither dismissing important findings nor catastrophizing over variants that might never cause you harm.
