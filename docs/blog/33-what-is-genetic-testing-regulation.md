# How Is Genetic Testing Regulated? FDA, CLIA, and What It Means for Consumer DNA Tests

If you've ever looked at your raw DNA file from 23andMe or AncestryDNA and wondered about the legal and regulatory status of that data, you're asking a more complex question than you might realize. Genetic testing exists in a regulatory landscape that's still being shaped and refined, and understanding this landscape helps you make informed decisions about your genetic information. Allelio operates explicitly as an educational tool outside of this medical testing framework, and that distinction is worth understanding.

## The FDA's Role in Genetic Testing

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authority over medical devices, diagnostics, and therapeutic products. When a genetic test is marketed as having medical value—as something that can diagnose, treat, or prevent disease—it falls under FDA jurisdiction as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD).

The FDA approval process for genetic tests involves reviewing scientific evidence that the test accurately detects the variants it claims to detect, and that those variants have meaningful medical implications. This is a rigorous process, but it's also been controversial in the genetic testing space because it can be slow, expensive, and complex.

For many years, the FDA took a hands-off approach to consumer genetic testing. In 2013, the FDA sent warning letters to direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies about making health claims without regulatory oversight. This prompted companies like 23andMe to stop offering certain health-related interpretations until they could obtain FDA authorization.

In 2015, 23andMe received FDA authorization for a limited number of health reports—specifically, ancestry and carrier status for certain genetic conditions. This was a landmark moment because it was one of the first FDA clearances for consumer genetic testing. Since then, more companies have sought and obtained FDA authorization for specific genetic tests.

However, FDA authorization doesn't apply to all genetic testing companies or to all tests they offer. Some companies focus on ancestry (which hasn't been regulated by the FDA the way health claims have), while others offer health information "for research purposes" or "without FDA authorization."

## CLIA: The Lab Certification Standard

While the FDA regulates genetic tests as medical devices, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulate the laboratories that perform genetic testing. CLIA is a federal program that certifies clinical laboratories based on the complexity of tests they perform.

Any laboratory that tests human specimens for diagnosing, treating, or preventing disease must be CLIA-certified. This means the laboratory must:
- Use validated testing methods
- Maintain quality control procedures
- Participate in proficiency testing
- Have qualified personnel
- Keep detailed records

When you send your saliva or blood sample to a commercial DNA testing company, they must use a CLIA-certified lab to process your sample. This is an important safeguard. It means your DNA is being analyzed using validated methods in a regulated laboratory setting, regardless of whether the company has FDA authorization for health reports.

However, CLIA primarily focuses on the accuracy of the test itself—did they correctly identify your genetic variants? CLIA doesn't regulate the interpretation of those variants or the health claims made based on them. That's where FDA authorization comes in.

## The Raw Data Exception: Largely Unregulated

Here's where it gets interesting for tools like Allelio. Most DNA testing companies allow you to download your raw data—the actual list of genetic variants identified in your sample. This raw data is essentially unregulated. You can download it, analyze it yourself, share it with other tools, or use it however you like.

From a regulatory perspective, raw DNA data is considered information, not a medical device. The FDA doesn't regulate information the way it regulates diagnostic tests. This is why Allelio can exist as a tool for analyzing your raw data without being subject to FDA approval. Allelio isn't claiming to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease—it's providing educational information about what your variants are and what published research says about them.

This regulatory gap exists because once the data is in your hands as raw information, the government has limited authority to regulate what you do with it or how you interpret it. This creates both opportunities and risks. The opportunity is that people can access and analyze their genetic information freely. The risk is that without regulatory oversight, interpretations can sometimes be misleading or presented without appropriate caveats.

## "For Research Use Only" vs. Clinical Claims

You'll sometimes see genetic information labeled "For Research Use Only" or "FURO." This designation essentially means the test hasn't been validated for clinical decision-making, and the company isn't making clinical claims about what the results mean for your health.

In contrast, tests that claim to diagnose or predict disease are making clinical claims and therefore need FDA authorization or must be performed in a clinical laboratory with appropriate licensing and oversight.

The distinction matters. If a test says "For Research Use Only," you should understand that while the genetic variants detected are likely accurate, the interpretation and clinical significance may not have been rigorously validated through the FDA process. This doesn't mean the information is wrong, but it means you're operating with less regulatory oversight.

## How Allelio Approaches Regulation

Allelio explicitly positions itself outside of the medical diagnostic framework. The tool analyzes your raw data and references published scientific databases—ClinVar, GWAS Catalog, and others—to show you what current research says about your variants. Crucially, Allelio doesn't diagnose diseases, prescribe treatments, or make specific medical recommendations.

This approach keeps Allelio in the educational space rather than the clinical space. By analyzing data you've already obtained from your own DNA test (rather than performing the test itself) and presenting information based on published scientific research (rather than making novel clinical claims), Allelio operates as an informational tool that complements, rather than replaces, professional medical advice.

This is why Allelio emphasizes that it's for educational purposes and not a substitute for medical advice. The tool helps you understand your genetic information, but for clinical decisions, you need to work with qualified healthcare professionals who can consider your complete health picture, not just your genetic data.

## International Regulation: IVDR and Beyond

The regulatory landscape varies significantly around the world. The European Union has been implementing increasingly strict regulations on in vitro diagnostic devices through the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), which took full effect in 2022.

Many countries have their own regulatory frameworks, and as genetic testing becomes more common globally, regulatory approaches continue to evolve. Some countries have more permissive approaches to direct-to-consumer genetic testing, while others have stricter requirements.

## Why Regulation Matters (and Doesn't)

Genetic testing regulation exists for good reasons. It ensures that tests accurately detect what they claim to detect, and that health information is presented responsibly. FDA authorization provides confidence that a test has been scientifically validated.

At the same time, not all genetic information needs to be regulated at the clinical level. Raw data analysis and educational exploration of genetic information can be valuable without FDA oversight, as long as it's presented with appropriate caveats about limitations.

The key is understanding what you're using. If you're making medical decisions based on genetic information, you should know whether that information comes from an FDA-authorized test, a CLIA-certified lab, or a less-regulated source. You should ask healthcare professionals to evaluate any genetic findings before changing medical treatment.

## The Regulatory Landscape Is Still Evolving

Genetic testing regulation is relatively young. The FDA is still working out how to handle new types of genetic tests, including polygenic risk scores (which estimate disease risk based on multiple genetic variants) and rare variant interpretation. Some experts argue for more regulation, while others worry that heavy-handed regulation could stifle innovation and limit people's access to genetic information.

As you use tools like Allelio and consider your genetic information, it's helpful to understand this regulatory context. Know where your data came from, understand what that source's regulatory status is, and use genetic information as one input into your health decisions, not as the sole basis for medical choices.

Understanding the regulatory framework also helps you approach genetic information with appropriate skepticism. If a company is making specific health claims without FDA authorization or without explaining the scientific basis for those claims, that's a red flag. Reputable sources explain their evidence, acknowledge limitations, and encourage you to consult healthcare professionals for medical decisions.
