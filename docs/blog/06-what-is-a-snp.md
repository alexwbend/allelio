# What Is a SNP? The Tiny DNA Differences That Make You Unique

Every human on Earth shares about 99.9% of their DNA. The remaining 0.1% — roughly 4 to 5 million positions scattered across your genome — is what makes you genetically distinct from every other person alive. The most common type of variation at those positions is called a SNP, and it's the foundation of everything Allelio does.

## SNP: The Basics

SNP stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, and it's pronounced "snip." A nucleotide is one of the four chemical bases that make up DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). A polymorphism is simply a position in the genome where more than one version exists in the population.

So a SNP is a single position in the genome where different people carry different letters. For example, at a specific spot on chromosome 19, most people might have a C, but some people have a T. That single-letter difference is a SNP.

You inherit two copies of each SNP — one from each parent. Your combination is called your genotype. If both parents passed you a C, your genotype is CC. If one passed a C and the other a T, your genotype is CT. If both passed a T, it's TT. These different versions (C and T, in this case) are called alleles.

## How Common Are SNPs?

Extremely common. Scientists have catalogued over 600 million SNPs in the human genome. Your genome contains roughly 4-5 million positions where you differ from the reference genome (a standardized "average" human genome used as a baseline for comparison).

Consumer DNA tests like 23andMe and AncestryDNA test between 600,000 and 900,000 SNPs — a carefully selected subset that covers the most informative positions. This is enough to assess ancestry, identify genetic relatives, and flag medically relevant variants, even though it's less than 0.1% of all known SNPs.

## What SNPs Can Tell You

Different SNPs do different things — or more precisely, have been associated with different traits through scientific research.

**Most SNPs are "silent."** They sit in regions of the genome that don't code for proteins or regulate gene activity. They have no known effect on your health or traits. These are still useful as genetic markers — they help trace ancestry and identify relatives — but they don't directly influence biology.

**Some SNPs affect protein structure.** If a SNP falls within a gene and changes the amino acid sequence of the protein that gene produces, it can alter how that protein functions. The sickle cell variant (rs334), for example, changes a single amino acid in the hemoglobin protein, which alters the shape of red blood cells.

**Some SNPs affect gene regulation.** Even SNPs outside of genes can matter. They might sit in a promoter, enhancer, or other regulatory region that controls when, where, and how much of a gene is expressed. A SNP that dials up expression of an inflammatory gene might increase susceptibility to autoimmune conditions.

**Some SNPs affect drug metabolism.** Pharmacogenomic SNPs influence how your body processes medications. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene, for example, determine whether you're a slow, normal, or fast metabolizer of many common drugs — affecting everything from antidepressant dosing to codeine efficacy.

## rsIDs: The Universal Naming System

Every catalogued SNP gets a reference identifier that starts with "rs" followed by a number — like rs429358, rs7412, or rs1800497. These rsIDs are maintained by the dbSNP database at NCBI and are used universally across genetics research.

When you see rs429358 in your Allelio results, scientists in Tokyo, London, and Boston know exactly which position in the genome that refers to. This standardization is what makes it possible to cross-reference your genotype data against research databases like ClinVar and the GWAS Catalog.

## SNPs vs. Other Types of Genetic Variation

SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation, but they're not the only type. Insertions and deletions (collectively called "indels") involve one or more bases being added or removed. Copy number variations (CNVs) involve entire chunks of DNA being duplicated or deleted. Structural variants involve large-scale rearrangements of chromosomal segments.

Consumer DNA chips primarily test SNPs (and, to a lesser extent, small indels). This means there's a large category of genetic variation that Allelio and similar tools simply can't see. A person might carry a clinically significant deletion or duplication that never appears in their 23andMe data because the chip wasn't designed to detect it.

This is one reason why consumer genotyping is not a replacement for clinical genetic testing. If a healthcare provider recommends genetic testing for a specific condition, they'll typically order targeted sequencing or a clinical panel that can detect the full range of variation in the relevant genes.

## The Risk of Overinterpreting a Single SNP

One of the most important things to understand about SNPs is that, for complex traits and diseases, any single SNP tells you very little. The media often reports findings like "scientists discover gene for obesity" or "gene linked to intelligence found." These headlines are almost always misleading.

What actually happened is that researchers found a SNP that is statistically associated with a tiny increase in the likelihood of a trait in a large population. The effect of any single SNP on a complex trait is usually minuscule — perhaps shifting risk by a fraction of a percent.

Your actual risk for any complex condition is determined by the combined effect of thousands of SNPs, plus your environment, diet, lifestyle, microbiome, socioeconomic factors, and random chance. A single SNP is one pixel in a million-pixel image.

This is why Allelio presents its findings with context and disclaimers. When the tool tells you that a variant is "associated with" a trait in the GWAS Catalog, it means exactly that — a statistical association observed in research populations, not a prediction about your individual future.

## What Makes SNPs Useful Despite Their Limitations

Even though individual SNPs have small effects, they're enormously useful in aggregate. Polygenic risk scores, which combine the effects of thousands of SNPs, are becoming increasingly powerful predictors of complex disease risk. Pharmacogenomic panels use SNPs to guide drug selection and dosing. Ancestry analysis uses patterns of SNPs across your genome to trace your geographic origins.

And for Mendelian conditions — diseases caused by a single gene — a single SNP absolutely can be definitive. The difference between carrying a pathogenic BRCA1 variant and not carrying it can be life-altering. ClinVar exists precisely to catalog these high-impact variants.

Allelio gives you access to both worlds: the high-impact clinical variants from ClinVar and the broader landscape of trait associations from the GWAS Catalog. Together, they provide an educational snapshot of what science currently knows about the positions in your genome that were tested.
