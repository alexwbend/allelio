# How to Talk to Your Doctor About Your Consumer DNA Results

You've run your genome through Allelio. You've seen the variant list, the ClinVar classifications, maybe the AI explanations. Something caught your eye — a "pathogenic" tag, a risk factor for a condition that runs in your family, or a pharmacogenomic variant that might explain why a medication never worked for you.

Now what?

The answer, almost always, is to talk to a healthcare professional. But walking into a doctor's appointment with consumer DNA results can be awkward. Many physicians have limited training in genetics. You might worry about being dismissed, or about wasting their time, or about not knowing how to explain what you found.

This guide will help you prepare for that conversation.

## Before Your Appointment

**Understand what you're bringing.** Consumer DNA results from Allelio (or any similar tool) are not clinical-grade genetic tests. They're based on genotyping chip data from 23andMe, AncestryDNA, or a similar service. Genotyping chips have known error rates and test only a subset of genetic variants. Your doctor needs to know this context.

**Print or save your report.** Allelio can generate an HTML report with your findings. Having a printed copy or a PDF on your phone makes the conversation easier. Focus on the variants that concern you rather than presenting hundreds of findings at once.

**Note the specific variants.** Write down the rsID numbers (like rs429358), the gene names, the ClinVar classifications, and the conditions listed. This gives your doctor specific, searchable terms to look up.

**Don't self-diagnose.** Walk in with questions, not conclusions. "Allelio flagged a variant classified as pathogenic in this gene, and I'd like to understand what that means for me" is a much better opening than "I think I have Lynch syndrome."

**Consider whether you want a genetic counselor instead.** For complex genetic findings, genetic counselors are specifically trained to interpret results and explain implications. If your concern involves hereditary cancer risk, a rare condition, or family planning, a genetic counselor may be the most appropriate first step. Many offer telehealth appointments, and you can find one at findageneticcounselor.nsgc.org.

## During the Conversation

**Start with your concern, not the technology.** Instead of leading with "I ran my genome through an open-source tool," try: "I've been looking into some genetic information and I have a question about my risk for [condition]." This centers the conversation on your health concern rather than the technology.

**Explain the source simply.** If your doctor asks where the information came from, keep it brief: "I used a tool that cross-references my raw DNA data from [23andMe/Ancestry] against the ClinVar clinical database and the GWAS research catalog. It flagged this variant, and I want to know if it's something we should follow up on."

**Show, don't just tell.** If you have your Allelio report, share it. Doctors can quickly assess whether a finding is potentially significant based on the gene, the classification, and the review status.

**Ask the right questions.** Here are some good ones to bring:

"Is this variant something that should be confirmed with a clinical-grade test?"

"Given my family history, does this finding change what screening I should be doing?"

"Should I be referred to a genetic counselor for a more detailed evaluation?"

"Does this affect any medications I'm currently taking or might take in the future?"

**Be prepared for uncertainty.** Your doctor might say they're not sure what a finding means. This is honest, not dismissive. Genetics is a rapidly evolving field, and most primary care physicians see genetic results infrequently. If your doctor is uncertain, a referral to a geneticist or genetic counselor is the right next step.

## What Your Doctor Might Do

Depending on your findings and your medical history, your doctor might take several different approaches.

**Reassurance.** If the finding is common, well-characterized, and doesn't change your medical management, your doctor may simply explain why it's not concerning. Many ClinVar variants — even some labeled "pathogenic" — have low penetrance or are associated with conditions you're unlikely to develop.

**Clinical confirmation testing.** If a consumer test flagged a potentially significant variant, clinical-grade testing through an accredited laboratory is the standard next step. This is especially important for high-impact genes like BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, or Lynch syndrome genes. Clinical tests are more accurate, test more variants, and produce results that can be used for medical decision-making.

**Referral.** Your doctor might refer you to a genetic counselor, a medical geneticist, or a specialist relevant to the condition in question (for example, an oncologist for hereditary cancer concerns, or a neurologist for neurodegenerative risk).

**Enhanced screening.** If a finding is confirmed and clinically significant, your doctor might recommend additional screening. For hereditary cancer syndromes, this could mean more frequent colonoscopies, breast MRIs, or other surveillance measures.

**No action.** For many findings — especially VUS (variants of uncertain significance) and small-effect GWAS associations — the appropriate action is simply to note the finding and revisit it if new information emerges. Not every genetic variant requires a response.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Don't demand specific tests or treatments based on consumer results.** Consumer genotyping is a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool. Let your healthcare provider guide the clinical path.

**Don't withhold information out of embarrassment.** Some people feel awkward bringing consumer DNA results to a doctor's appointment. Don't. You're being proactive about your health, and a good clinician will respect that.

**Don't change medications on your own.** If Allelio identifies a pharmacogenomic variant that might affect how you metabolize a drug, bring it to your doctor. Do not stop or change a medication without medical guidance.

**Don't ignore findings that concern you.** If something in your results is causing you anxiety, address it. Uncertainty is often worse than knowledge, and a healthcare professional can help put findings in perspective.

**Don't expect your doctor to know everything about genetics.** Medical genetics is a specialty for a reason. If your primary care physician isn't sure how to interpret a finding, that's an honest answer — and a referral to someone who can help is the right outcome.

## The Bigger Picture

Consumer genomics is still relatively new, and the healthcare system is still adapting to it. More and more patients are walking into appointments with DNA data in hand, and the medical community is gradually developing better frameworks for handling these conversations.

By preparing thoughtfully, focusing on specific concerns, and approaching the conversation as a collaboration rather than a confrontation, you can make the most of your genetic information while getting the professional guidance that complex findings deserve.

Allelio gives you access to published scientific data about your genome. A healthcare professional turns that data into personalized, actionable guidance. Both halves are important.
