# The Future of Personal Genomics: What's Coming Next for Consumer DNA Testing

The landscape of consumer genetics has changed dramatically in the past decade. DNA testing moved from science fiction to something you can order online. Millions of people now have access to their raw genetic data. Tools like Allelio make it possible to analyze that data privately and locally. But this is just the beginning. Several major trends are reshaping the field, and understanding them will help you make sense of personal genomics over the next 5-10 years.

## Trend 1: Falling Sequencing Costs

One of the most powerful trends in genomics is the relentless decline in sequencing costs. Twenty years ago, sequencing a human genome cost millions of dollars. Ten years ago, it cost thousands. Today, it costs hundreds, and the price keeps dropping.

This has massive implications. As sequencing becomes cheaper, more people will have access to complete genetic information. We're moving from a world where only sick people get sequenced (in clinical contexts) to a world where healthy people can afford to sequence their own genomes for personal interest or preventive health.

Cheaper sequencing means more genetic data, which means better population databases, which means we'll understand rare variants better. It also means more genetic data for AI systems to learn from, which will make variant interpretation more accurate (assuming the AI systems are trained responsibly).

Allelio works with consumer data and raw sequences today, but as whole-genome sequencing becomes more common, tools like Allelio will become increasingly valuable for interpreting that richer data.

## Trend 2: Whole Genome Sequencing Going Mainstream

Today, most consumer DNA tests use SNP chips — they test about 600,000 to 1 million pre-selected variants. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) reads your entire 3 billion base pairs. It's more expensive than SNP chips, but the costs are dropping fast.

WGS has huge advantages:

- **It finds rare variants.** SNP chips miss rare variants by design. WGS captures them all.
- **It finds structural variations.** Large deletions, duplications, and inversions that SNP chips miss.
- **It's future-proof.** As research advances and we learn more about genetic variants, you don't need to retest — your WGS data already has everything.

As WGS becomes cheaper, we'll see the shift from "consumer SNP chips" to "consumer sequencing." This is already happening. Some companies now offer whole genome sequencing at competitive prices. This trend will accelerate.

For tools like Allelio, WGS data is richer and more powerful. You'll be able to find more insights, more rare variants, and more complete interpretation of your genetics.

## Trend 3: Polygenic Risk Scores Entering Clinical Use

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are sophisticated calculations that look at hundreds or thousands of genetic variants and combine them to estimate your risk for a particular disease. Unlike single genes, which predict risk with high certainty, PRS predictions are probabilistic — they say "people with your genetic profile have X% risk" not "you have this disease."

PRS research has exploded. Scientists have now developed PRS for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, psychiatric conditions, and more. These tools have been in research for years, but they're now starting to enter clinical practice.

Within 5-10 years, it's likely that:

- Many doctors will offer genetic PRS testing as part of preventive health
- Insurance companies might use PRS scores to influence coverage or pricing (which raises ethical questions)
- PRS results will become a standard part of health records
- Personalized prevention strategies will be based on PRS scores more often

Allelio currently shows you individual variants and what research says about them. As PRS becomes more mainstream, tools like Allelio might integrate PRS calculations, giving you a more complete picture of your genetic risk profile.

## Trend 4: Pharmacogenomics Becoming Standard of Care

Pharmacogenomics — how your genetics influence which medications work for you and at what dose — is moving from research to clinical practice.

Your genetics influence drug metabolism. Some people metabolize certain medications quickly (and need higher doses), while others metabolize them slowly (and risk toxicity at standard doses). This is why some medications work great for one person and not at all for another.

Increasingly, doctors are checking genes like CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and others before prescribing medications. This prevents adverse drug reactions, improves medication efficacy, and saves money. Within a few years, having your pharmacogenomics profile in your medical record will be standard.

This is one area where genetics directly influences medical care in a proven, practical way. It's not controversial. It's not about disease risk. It's about matching you with medications that work for your body.

Tools like Allelio that give you insight into your own pharmacogenomics data will become increasingly relevant as people want to understand their own drug metabolism.

## Trend 5: CRISPR and Gene Therapy Advancing

CRISPR gene editing is moving from lab breakthrough to medical treatment. The first CRISPR therapies for genetic diseases have been approved and more are in development. Sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and some eye diseases are being treated with CRISPR-based approaches.

Within 10-20 years, CRISPR and other gene therapies will likely treat many genetic diseases that are currently untreatable. This has profound implications: genetic diseases that seemed like life-long conditions might become curable.

For personal genomics, this means finding out you have a pathogenic genetic variant won't necessarily be a death sentence or life-limiting condition. Genetic testing might reveal a condition that you could have treated with gene therapy.

## Trend 6: Multi-Omics Integration

Genomics is expanding to include the whole picture of your biology. Beyond just DNA, researchers are now integrating:

- **Transcriptomics.** Which genes are actually being expressed in your cells
- **Proteomics.** Which proteins your cells are making
- **Metabolomics.** Which small molecules are circulating in your blood
- **Microbiomics.** The bacteria in your gut and their genetic makeup

Combining these gives a far more complete picture than DNA alone. Your DNA might have a variant that predisposes you to diabetes, but your gene expression, metabolites, and gut microbiome tell you whether you're actually developing diabetes right now.

We're not there yet for consumer use, but within 5-10 years, you might be able to get a "health report" that integrates your DNA with your actual metabolic state. This will be much more informative than DNA alone.

## Trend 7: AI Getting Better (and More Responsible)

AI systems for interpreting genetic variants are improving rapidly. Training on larger datasets, better integration with literature and databases, and learning from real clinical outcomes all make AI better at understanding genetics.

But there's a counter-trend: growing awareness of AI risks (like hallucination, as we discussed in an earlier post) is leading to more responsible AI use. Future versions of tools like Allelio will probably integrate AI more, but with better safety measures and clearer communication about uncertainty.

The goal is AI that's genuinely useful for interpretation without being overconfident or making up facts.

## Trend 8: Local/Private Tools Becoming More Important

As data volumes increase and privacy concerns grow, there's growing interest in tools that keep your data private. You don't want to upload your whole genome to the cloud just to analyze it.

Allelio's approach — local processing using local AI and local databases — represents a trend that will likely grow. Privacy-first genomics isn't just about security; it's about principle. You should be able to analyze your own data without any company or server knowing anything about you.

As datasets get larger and more people use genomics tools, privacy-preserving approaches will become increasingly valuable.

## Trend 9: Ancestry and Population Diversity

Consumer genealogy and ancestry testing exploded, and it's now revealing something important: most genetic research has been biased toward European ancestry populations.

The effect is obvious: genetic variants are better understood in people of European ancestry. Novel variants in people of African, East Asian, or South Asian ancestry are more likely to be classified as "uncertain significance" because we have less data about them.

This is changing. Projects like All of Us Biobank are collecting diverse genetic data. Researchers are publishing variants in diverse populations. Over time, we'll have better understanding of how variants affect people of all ancestries.

This matters because a variant that's "benign in Europeans" might have different effects in other populations, or might be rare and thus more suspicious in other populations. Allelio and other tools will benefit from better, more diverse genetic knowledge.

## Trend 10: Ethical and Regulatory Frameworks Evolving

Finally, as personal genomics becomes mainstream, society is asking hard questions about ethics and policy.

Who owns your genetic data? How long can companies keep it? Can law enforcement access it without your consent? Can employers or insurers see your genetic results? What's the line between genetic information and privacy?

These are actively being debated. Some countries are passing genetic privacy laws. Insurance regulations are being tightened. Bioethics committees are wrestling with tough questions.

This evolution will shape what tools like Allelio can do and how they can operate. But it should also increase protection for users — making it harder for bad actors to exploit genetic data while maintaining the benefits of personal genomics.

## What This Means for You

If you're interested in your genetics, these trends suggest that:

- Your raw genetic data will become increasingly valuable and interpretable as tools improve
- You'll want tools you trust and that protect your privacy
- Genetic insights will become increasingly clinical, not just interesting
- You'll need to stay skeptical and informed as genetics enters mainstream medicine
- Your data will reveal more about your health, for better or worse

Tools like Allelio are designed for this future: they let you control your own data, understand it deeply, and make informed decisions about your health — all without compromising privacy.

## The Bottom Line

Personal genomics is in its infancy. The field is moving fast. The convergence of cheaper sequencing, better AI, richer databases, and privacy-conscious tools like Allelio means we're entering an era where anyone can understand their own genetics deeply and privately.

The future is not about companies controlling your genetic data. It's about you controlling your data and using transparent tools to understand it. Allelio and projects like it are building that future.
