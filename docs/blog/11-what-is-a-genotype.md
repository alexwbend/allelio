# What Is a Genotype? Understanding the Two Letters That Describe Each of Your DNA Variants

Your DNA is made up of billions of individual letters—A, T, G, and C—arranged in a specific sequence. At certain positions in that sequence, many people have different versions. We call these positions **variants**, and the specific letters you have at each position is called your **genotype**. Understanding genotypes is essential to reading and interpreting your own genetic results from Allelio.

## What Exactly Is a Genotype?

A genotype is simply the pair of DNA letters you inherit at a specific location in your genome. Because humans are diploid—we have two copies of almost every gene (one from each parent)—each variant position shows up as a pair of letters.

You might see something like:
- **AA** (two A's)
- **AG** (one A and one G)
- **TT** (two T's)
- **TC** (one T and one C)

Each of those letters is called an **allele**. So your genotype at any position is made up of two alleles.

## Homozygous vs Heterozygous

When both of your letters are the same—like AA or TT—you're **homozygous** for that variant. The Greek root "homo" means "same," so this makes sense. Homozygous variants are particularly important in genetics because they often have stronger effects than heterozygous ones, though this depends heavily on the specific gene and condition.

When your two letters are different—like AG or TC—you're **heterozygous**. The Greek root "hetero" means "different." Being heterozygous means you inherited one version from one parent and a different version from your other parent.

This distinction matters because some genetic conditions are recessive—meaning you need two copies of the variant to be affected—while others are dominant—meaning one copy is enough. We'll dive deeper into that in another post about inheritance patterns.

## How to Read Genotype Notation

When you look at your Allelio results or any genomic data, genotypes follow a standard notation. The most common you'll see are:

- **AA, TT, GG, CC**: These show two identical letters. You inherited the same allele from both parents.
- **AT, AG, AC, TG, TC, GC**: These show two different letters. You inherited different alleles from each parent.

The order sometimes matters in technical databases, but what matters for interpretation is that you have those two letters, regardless of which position they're in.

In some older reports, you might also see notation like:
- **1/1** (homozygous for the first allele)
- **0/1** (heterozygous)
- **0/0** (homozygous for the second allele)

Allelio tries to use the clearer letter notation, since it's more intuitive than numbers.

## Reference Allele vs Alternate Allele

Here's a concept that trips up many people: when geneticists talk about variants, they're always comparing against a **reference genome**—a standardized version of the human genome that serves as a baseline. We talk more about reference genomes in another post, but here's what matters for genotypes:

The **reference allele** is what appears at that position in the reference genome—what's considered the "standard." The **alternate allele** is the version found in some people but not the reference. When you see a variant listed as "A>G," this means the reference has an A, and you (or someone) have a G instead.

Your genotype tells you how many alternate alleles you have:
- **AA** = zero alternate alleles (homozygous for the reference)
- **AG** = one alternate allele (heterozygous)
- **GG** = two alternate alleles (homozygous for the alternate)

This notation is especially important when you're looking at ClinVar or other databases, because the pathogenicity is usually described relative to the alternate allele.

## What Does "No-Call" Mean?

Not every position in your genome will give a clear result. Sometimes the testing technology doesn't capture enough signal, or the data quality at that position is uncertain. When this happens, the result is marked as "no-call," often shown as "./.."

This doesn't mean anything is wrong with you—it just means that particular variant couldn't be confidently determined from your DNA sample. It's like a question on a test that's too blurry to read: you skip it and move on. Allelio will flag these, and they won't be included in your analysis, which is the right call for safety.

## Why Zygosity Matters for Your Health

Here's where genotypes become medically relevant: whether you're homozygous or heterozygous for a variant can completely change whether it affects your health.

For **dominant conditions**, like hereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by BRCA1 mutations, being heterozygous (having just one copy) is enough to increase your risk. You only need one "bad" copy.

For **recessive conditions**, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia, you typically need to be homozygous—carrying two copies of the pathogenic variant—to actually have the disease. If you're heterozygous, you're a carrier but usually unaffected.

This is why Allelio carefully notes whether you're homozygous or heterozygous for each variant it finds. The zygosity is part of the story about whether a variant matters for you.

## The Big Picture: Genotype Is Your Starting Point

Your genotype—those two letters at each variant position—is the fundamental piece of information that all genomic analysis starts with. From genotypes, we ask bigger questions: Is this variant in a disease-associated gene? Do I carry it or have it? Could it affect my health or my children's health?

Understanding genotypes prepares you to understand those deeper questions. When you look at your Allelio results and see a variant listed with a genotype like AG or TT, you now know exactly what that means: you have those specific two alleles at that specific location, one inherited from each parent.
