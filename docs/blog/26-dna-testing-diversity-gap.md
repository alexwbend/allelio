# The Diversity Gap in Genetics Research: Why Your Ancestry Affects the Accuracy of DNA Results

Imagine you upload your DNA data to Allelio and receive results about your genetic risk for heart disease. But what if those results are less accurate because most of the research they're based on was conducted on people from Europe? Or what if a variant is flagged as disease-causing in your results, but that's only because it was rare in European populations and therefore not thoroughly studied in your own?

This is the diversity gap in genetics—a significant and growing problem that affects how accurately your DNA results apply to you based on your ancestry.

## The Numbers Behind the Gap

The reality is stark: approximately 80% of participants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)—the large research projects that identify genetic risk factors—have been of European ancestry. This overrepresentation has been consistent for decades, creating a massive blind spot in our genetic knowledge.

Why does this matter? Because genetic variation isn't evenly distributed across populations. Different populations have different common variants, different rare variants, and different patterns of genetic linkage. When research is conducted overwhelmingly on one group, the findings often don't translate well to others.

The consequences are real and concerning: genetic risk scores developed on European populations perform worse in other populations. Variants that are harmless in one population might be pathogenic (disease-causing) in another, or vice versa. Rare variants in one ancestry group might be common in another, changing their clinical significance.

## How the Bias Affects Your Results

Let's walk through some concrete examples:

**Risk Score Accuracy**: A genetic risk score for type 2 diabetes developed on 100,000 European participants might explain 5% of disease variation in that population. But when applied to African American or Asian populations, it might only explain 2-3% of variation. The predictions get worse because the genetic architecture is different.

**Misclassification of Variants**: In databases like ClinVar (which Allelio uses), some variants are classified as benign because they were common in European populations and didn't seem harmful. But in populations where they're rare, they might have been classified as pathogenic based on limited data. Or vice versa: a truly pathogenic variant might be underrepresented in databases because it's rare outside of specific populations.

**Missing Variants Entirely**: Because sequencing studies have mostly included Europeans, we have better catalogs of European variants. Non-European variants—especially rare ones—are simply underrepresented in our databases. If you have ancestry from Africa, South Asia, or other regions less represented in research, important variants affecting your health might not even be in the databases Allelio queries.

**Pharmacogenomics**: How you metabolize medications is partly genetic. But most pharmacogenomic research has been on Europeans. If you're a person of color, the drugs and doses recommended based on genetic tests might be less accurate.

## Why This Happened

The diversity gap didn't emerge from malice. It's the result of several converging factors:

**Geography**: Most large genetic research institutions are in North America and Europe, where it's easier to recruit large cohorts quickly.

**Funding**: Research funding decisions historically prioritized studying wealthy, educated populations, partly because they were easiest to reach in health systems.

**Historical Context**: The legacy of unethical research on Black, Indigenous, and other communities (the Tuskegee experiment, forced sterilization programs, etc.) created justified distrust and reluctance to participate in genetic research.

**Infrastructure**: Countries with older genomic databases and cohorts are more likely to have datasets available for research, and those happen to be wealthier countries with majority-European populations.

**Convenience**: Researchers followed the path of least resistance, using populations already available in hospital systems and biobanks.

## The Consequences Beyond Accuracy

The diversity gap doesn't just affect accuracy—it affects equity. When genetic risk scores perform worse in non-European populations, doctors might under-screen or over-screen. Variants classified as pathogenic might not truly be harmful in your population. Treatment recommendations based on genetic data might not apply.

And there's a deeper issue: if you're not represented in genetic research, you're not included in the science that's shaping medicine. Your genetic variation, your disease patterns, your biology matters less in the grand scheme of genetic knowledge.

## Recent Efforts to Close the Gap

The scientific community is increasingly aware of and working to address this problem:

**H3Africa** (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) is a major research initiative focused on conducting genetic research in African populations and understanding African genetic variation.

**All of Us Research Program** (from the National Institutes of Health) aims to recruit one million Americans, with intentional focus on recruiting from communities historically underrepresented in research.

**National Biobanks** in various countries are collecting DNA and health data from diverse populations.

**Diverse Ancestry Resources** like the Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network (AGEN) and the Diversity and Disparities in Asthma Outcomes (GALA II) study are adding non-European data to our knowledge base.

**Database Improvements**: Projects like gnomAD are working to include more diverse populations. ClinVar, which Allelio uses, is improving how variants are classified across populations.

But we're still early. These efforts require funding, trust-building, and time to accumulate large datasets comparable to the existing European ones.

## What This Means for You Using Allelio

If you're using Allelio and you have non-European ancestry, here are some things to keep in mind:

**Your results might be less accurate** than they are for someone of European ancestry. This is especially true for complex disease risk scores and for rare variants.

**A variant flagged as pathogenic might need additional clinical evaluation**, particularly if you're in an ancestry group underrepresented in research. Consider discussing unexpected or concerning findings with a genetic counselor or physician.

**The absence of data in a database doesn't mean you don't carry a variant**. It might mean the variant hasn't been studied much in people from your ancestry group.

**Risk scores should be interpreted with extra caution**, understanding that they're partially based on research that doesn't fully represent your population.

**You can contribute to closing the gap** by participating in research studies that specifically recruit from your community, or by supporting initiatives focused on diverse genomic research.

## Moving Toward Inclusive Genetics

The future of accurate, equitable genetic medicine requires more diverse datasets, more research in non-European populations, and more diversity in the genetics workforce itself. It requires acknowledging that the science we've built is incomplete and biased, and committing to do better.

For now, Allelio and similar tools offer valuable information, but especially for people of non-European ancestry, the results should be interpreted with awareness of these limitations. Your genetics are worth studying, your ancestry matters, and you deserve tools that work as well for you as they do for others.
