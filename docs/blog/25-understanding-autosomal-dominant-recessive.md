# Dominant vs. Recessive: A Simple Guide to How Genetic Conditions Are Inherited

You've probably heard the words "dominant" and "recessive" thrown around in discussions of genetics. Maybe you were told you carry a "recessive" disease variant, or you learned that a "dominant" disease runs in your family. But what do these terms actually mean, and why do they matter for understanding your DNA results?

The answer has to do with how genes work. Most of us have two copies of each gene—one inherited from our mother and one from our father. Dominant and recessive describe what happens when one of those copies carries a mutation that could cause disease.

## Autosomal Dominant Conditions: One Bad Copy Is Enough

In an autosomal dominant condition, you only need one mutated copy of a gene to develop the disease. Having the mutation on one chromosome is enough to cause trouble.

**Huntington's Disease** is perhaps the most famous example. It's caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. If you inherit one copy of the mutated gene from either parent, you will develop Huntington's disease. You don't need two copies—one is sufficient. (Autosomal means the gene is on one of the non-sex chromosomes, as opposed to the X chromosome.)

**Marfan Syndrome**, a connective tissue disorder affecting height, vision, and the heart, follows the same pattern. One mutated copy of the FBN1 gene causes Marfan syndrome.

**Some hereditary cancers** show dominant inheritance too. Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (famous from recent celebrity discussions) increase cancer risk significantly in people who carry even one mutated copy.

## What Does This Mean for Families?

If you have an autosomal dominant condition, each of your children has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation from you (and thus developing the condition). Your siblings have a 50% chance of carrying it. Parents usually have it too—unless your mutation arose new (de novo), a spontaneous error in the egg or sperm that created you.

This has profound implications. An affected parent can pass the condition to any child. The disease often "runs in families" in a clear, vertical line—grandparent, parent, child, all affected. There's nowhere to hide: if you carry the mutation, you'll develop symptoms (barring rare exceptions).

## Autosomal Recessive Conditions: You Need Two Bad Copies

Recessive conditions are different. You need two mutated copies of the gene—one from each parent—to develop the disease. If you have only one mutated copy, you're a "carrier" but typically don't develop the condition.

**Cystic Fibrosis** is recessive. You need two mutated copies of the CFTR gene to have cystic fibrosis. If you carry one, you're a carrier—healthy, but able to pass the mutation to your children.

**Sickle Cell Disease** is recessive. Two mutated copies cause the disease. One copy actually confers some protection against malaria (which is why the mutation has remained common in populations from malaria-endemic regions), but doesn't cause disease.

**Thalassemia Major**, **Ataxia-Telangiectasia**, and **Hemochromatosis** (in its most severe forms) are all recessive.

## What Does This Mean for Families?

Recessive inheritance can feel like a surprise because carriers can feel perfectly healthy and be unaware they carry a mutation. Two carrier parents—each with one mutated copy—have a 25% chance with each pregnancy of having a child with the disease (two mutated copies), a 50% chance of having a carrier child (one mutated copy), and a 25% chance of a child with two normal copies.

This is why recessive conditions sometimes "skip generations" or appear in families with no obvious history of the disease. Both parents might be carriers from their respective families, and only when they have a child do two mutations meet and produce disease.

## X-Linked Conditions: Different Rules for Females and Males

Some conditions are caused by mutations on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes). This creates different inheritance patterns for males and females.

Males have one X chromosome (and one Y). If they inherit a mutated X, they express the mutation—because they have no second X to "cover" for it. Hemophilia and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy are classic X-linked conditions affecting mostly males.

Females have two X chromosomes. If they inherit one mutated X, they're usually carriers (like recessive inheritance). But females can sometimes develop disease from X-linked mutations if both X chromosomes carry mutations, or through skewed X-inactivation (a process where one X is preferentially used, leaving the mutated X to express).

## Understanding Your Allelio Results

When Allelio reports a genetic variant, the inheritance pattern matters enormously:

**If you find a dominant mutation**: This is usually significant. You likely carry disease risk, and if you develop it, you may pass it to children. A genetic counselor or doctor should help you understand what this means.

**If you find one recessive mutation (and are a carrier)**: You're healthy, but your children could be affected if their other parent is also a carrier. This is especially important if you're planning pregnancy or if there's family history in your partner's background.

**If you find two recessive mutations**: You likely have the condition or will develop it. This requires medical attention.

The inheritance pattern also affects how to talk to relatives. If you carry a dominant mutation, siblings and parents are at risk. If you're a carrier for something recessive, your siblings might be too, and if they have children with someone else who's a carrier, their children might be affected.

## A Simple Visual: The Punnett Square

Geneticists use something called a Punnett square to map out inheritance. Imagine a dominant mutation (D for mutated, d for normal):

A parent with Dd (one mutated copy) and another parent with dd (two normal copies) can have:
- 50% Dd (one mutated copy—shows the dominant condition)
- 50% dd (two normal copies—unaffected)

For a recessive condition, two carriers (Cc) can have:
- 25% CC (normal)
- 50% Cc (carriers, unaffected)
- 25% cc (affected)

These simple rules have shaped human health and families for thousands of years.

## Why This Matters Beyond Just DNA

Understanding dominant and recessive inheritance isn't just academic. It shapes medical decisions about screening, pregnancy planning, and family communication. It explains why some diseases run clearly in families while others surprise us. And it reminds us that our genetics don't exist in isolation—they exist in the context of family, inheritance, and relationships.

When you use Allelio or look at your raw DNA data, knowing whether a condition is dominant or recessive changes how you should interpret what you find and what you should do with that information.
