# Epigenetics: The Important Layer of Biology That DNA Tests Can't See

Your raw DNA file from 23andMe or AncestryDNA is incomplete. Not because the test is poorly designed—it's not—but because DNA itself is only part of the story. There's an entire layer of biological regulation called epigenetics that controls whether your genes are turned "on" or "off," and standard DNA tests can't see it. This means your genetic risk profile, as revealed through Allelio, is missing a crucial dimension.

## What Is Epigenetics? The Switches on Your Genes

Imagine DNA as a library of instruction manuals. You have two copies of most genes—one from each parent. Having a gene doesn't automatically mean it's active. The real question is: is this manual being read right now?

Epigenetics is the system of switches and dimmers that control gene expression—which genes are being actively used and which are dormant. The DNA sequence itself stays the same, but chemical tags attached to DNA and proteins can turn genes up or down.

The two main mechanisms are:

**DNA methylation.** A methyl group (a tiny chemical tag) can attach to cytosine, one of the four DNA bases. Methylated genes are usually less active. This is reversible—the methyl group can be added or removed, changing whether the gene is expressed.

**Histone modifications.** DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones. Chemical modifications to these proteins can tighten or loosen the wrapping, making genes more or less accessible. It's like a filing system where you can make drawers harder or easier to open.

These chemical modifications don't change the underlying DNA sequence. The genetic code remains identical. But the regulation of that code changes dramatically.

## Genes Can Be "Off" Without Being Broken

Here's a critical insight: you can carry a normal, functional gene that's simply not being expressed in your cells. Perhaps it's methylated into silence. Perhaps the histone wrapping keeps it inaccessible. The gene is there, intact, but it's not being read.

This is actually how cells specialize. Your liver cells and brain cells contain identical DNA, but different genes are active in each. Epigenetic modifications ensure that liver genes are active in liver tissue and brain genes are active in brain tissue. The DNA is the same; the regulation is different.

For disease, this is profound. Some cancers arise not from mutations but from epigenetic silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. The protective genes are still there, but they're switched off. Conversely, some diseases involve genes that are over-expressed due to epigenetic changes that make them too accessible.

A standard genetic test—including the ones Allelio analyzes—looks at the DNA sequence. It can't tell you whether your genes are epigenetically silenced or active. This is a major blind spot.

## Why Identical Twins Diverge Over Time

One of the most striking demonstrations of epigenetics comes from identical twins. Monozygotic twins start with identical DNA. Yet as they age, their health outcomes diverge. One might develop diabetes while the other doesn't. One might have more depression; the other remains resilient. Why?

The DNA is the same. But the epigenetic modifications have diverged.

Identical twins raised together initially share similar epigenetic patterns because they share environment, diet, and lifestyle. But over decades, different stresses, experiences, and exposures accumulate different epigenetic changes. The methylation patterns in a 70-year-old identical twin are measurably different from their sibling, even though the DNA sequence is identical.

This is powerful evidence that epigenetics matters independently of genetics. And it means that genetic risk is not destiny. Two people with identical genotypes can have very different health outcomes depending on their epigenetic trajectories.

## How Diet, Stress, and Environment Affect Gene Expression

This is where the rubber meets the road. Your environment doesn't change your DNA, but it does change your epigenetics.

**Diet** influences epigenetics through compounds that affect histone modifications. Certain nutrients act as methyl donors—they provide the chemical building blocks for DNA methylation. B vitamins, folate, and choline all influence methylation patterns. A diet rich in these nutrients may alter gene expression compared to a deficient diet, even though the genetic code remains unchanged.

**Stress** triggers epigenetic changes as your body adapts to threat. The stress hormone cortisol influences histone modification patterns. Chronic stress can lead to sustained epigenetic changes that affect immune function, inflammation, and even your cancer risk.

**Physical activity** epigenetically influences metabolic genes. Exercise alters histone modifications in genes related to energy metabolism, potentially improving insulin sensitivity and reducing diabetes risk.

**Environmental toxins** like air pollution and heavy metals can cause epigenetic modifications that silence protective genes or activate inflammatory ones.

**Social factors** like social isolation, discrimination, and unstable housing create chronic stress that leaves epigenetic marks on immune and metabolic genes.

What's remarkable is that many of these epigenetic changes are *reversible*. If you improve your diet, reduce stress, or increase exercise, some epigenetic patterns can shift back toward healthier states. This doesn't mean your genetics changes, but your epigenetics—and your gene expression—can change.

## Why a SNP Test Gives an Incomplete Picture

When Allelio analyzes your raw DNA data, it's giving you important information about genetic risk variants. But it's not telling you:

- Whether those risk genes are active or silenced
- What your current epigenetic state is
- How lifestyle modifications might change your epigenetic regulation
- Whether epigenetic changes might override or amplify genetic risk

A person with genetic risk for obesity might have different weight trajectories depending on whether obesity-related genes are epigenetically active or silenced. A person with genetic risk for depression might have different mental health outcomes depending on epigenetic modifications influenced by stress and social support.

This isn't a flaw in Allelio—it's a fundamental limitation of current consumer genetic testing. Measuring epigenetics requires specialized, expensive tests that aren't part of standard panels. But it's important context.

## What This Means for Interpreting Risk

If Allelio shows you genetic risk variants, consider these points:

**Your genetics is not your destiny.** Genetic risk is real but incomplete. Epigenetics provides a mechanism for lifestyle and environment to influence gene expression.

**Modifiable factors matter.** While you can't change your DNA sequence, you can influence your epigenetic state through diet, exercise, stress management, and social connection. These aren't just feel-good recommendations—they're biological interventions.

**Individual trajectories vary.** Two people with identical genetic risk variants can have different outcomes. Part of this is epigenetics, part is environment, part is random chance.

**Monitoring is useful.** Rather than seeing genetic results as fixed predictions, consider them as information for choosing behaviors that might favorably influence epigenetic regulation.

**Talk to professionals.** If you're concerned about genetic risk for a specific condition, professionals like genetic counselors can help you explore what's modifiable and what evidence exists for lifestyle interventions.

## The Future of Epigenetics in Consumer Testing

As technology improves, consumer epigenetic testing may become more accessible. Companies are developing tests that measure methylation patterns or histone modifications to estimate biological aging or disease risk. Allelio may eventually incorporate epigenetic data alongside genetic data.

For now, the most practical takeaway is this: your DNA is not destiny, and your health is more malleable than genetics alone suggests. Allelio tells you about one layer—important, but incomplete. The lifestyle choices you make, the stress you manage, the relationships you nurture—these influence your health through epigenetic mechanisms that can be just as powerful as your genetic variants.
