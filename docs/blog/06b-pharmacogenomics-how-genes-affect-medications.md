# Pharmacogenomics: How Your DNA Affects Which Medications Work for You

You've probably had the experience: a medication that works perfectly for a friend does nothing for you, or gives you side effects that nobody warned you about. You might have chalked it up to bad luck. In many cases, it's actually your genes.

Pharmacogenomics — the study of how genetic variation affects drug response — is one of the most practical applications of genetic testing. And it's one of the areas where Allelio's results can be most immediately relevant to your life.

## Why the Same Drug Affects People Differently

When you take a medication, your body has to do several things with it: absorb it, transport it, convert it into its active form (or break it down into inactive byproducts), and eventually eliminate it. At nearly every step, enzymes and proteins encoded by your genes are doing the work.

If a genetic variant changes the activity of one of those enzymes — making it faster, slower, or nonfunctional — it changes how the drug behaves in your body. A faster-than-normal enzyme might break down a drug before it has time to work. A slower-than-normal enzyme might let it accumulate to dangerous levels.

This isn't rare. Studies suggest that over 90% of people carry at least one genetic variant that could affect their response to a commonly prescribed medication.

## The Key Players: CYP Enzymes

The most well-studied pharmacogenomic genes belong to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family. These enzymes, produced mainly in the liver, are responsible for metabolizing a vast number of medications.

**CYP2D6** metabolizes about 25% of all commonly prescribed drugs, including many antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine), pain medications (codeine, tramadol), beta-blockers, and antipsychotics. Genetic variants in CYP2D6 determine whether you're a poor metabolizer (the enzyme works slowly or not at all), intermediate metabolizer, extensive/normal metabolizer, or ultrarapid metabolizer (the enzyme works faster than average).

For codeine, this distinction is clinically critical. Codeine is a prodrug — it must be converted by CYP2D6 into morphine to work. Poor metabolizers get almost no pain relief from codeine. Ultrarapid metabolizers convert it too quickly, potentially producing dangerous morphine levels. The FDA has issued a black-box warning about this.

**CYP2C19** metabolizes several important drugs, including the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix), many proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole), and certain antidepressants. Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 may not adequately activate clopidogrel, potentially reducing its effectiveness in preventing blood clots after a stent placement.

**CYP2C9** metabolizes warfarin, the widely used blood thinner. Variants in CYP2C9 (along with variants in the VKORC1 gene) can dramatically affect the dose of warfarin needed to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients with certain CYP2C9 variants may need significantly lower doses and are at higher risk of bleeding complications at standard doses.

## Beyond Metabolism: Other Pharmacogenes

Drug response isn't only about how fast you break a drug down.

**HLA genes** (human leukocyte antigen) are part of your immune system. Certain HLA variants are associated with severe, potentially life-threatening drug hypersensitivity reactions. For example, the HLA-B*5701 allele is strongly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity — a dangerous reaction to an HIV medication. Testing for HLA-B*5701 before prescribing abacavir is now standard of care.

**VKORC1** affects sensitivity to warfarin independent of CYP2C9. Variants in VKORC1 influence how much warfarin is needed to achieve the desired anticoagulant effect.

**DPYD** encodes an enzyme that breaks down fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy drugs (like 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine). Patients with DPYD deficiency can develop severe, life-threatening toxicity from standard chemotherapy doses. Pre-treatment DPYD testing is increasingly recommended.

**SLCO1B1** affects the transport of statin medications. Certain variants increase the risk of statin-induced muscle pain (myopathy), which is one of the most common reasons people stop taking statins.

## What Allelio Can Show You

When you analyze your genome with Allelio, variants with known pharmacogenomic relevance may appear in your results. ClinVar includes drug-response classifications for many variants, and the GWAS Catalog contains studies on drug efficacy and adverse reactions.

Allelio categorizes some of these under "Pharmacogenomics" in your results. You might see, for example, that you carry a CYP2D6 variant classified as affecting drug metabolism, or an HLA variant associated with a specific drug reaction.

These findings can be genuinely useful — but with an important caveat. Consumer genotyping chips test only a subset of the known pharmacogenomic variants. A comprehensive pharmacogenomic assessment requires targeted clinical testing that covers all relevant variants in each gene, including rare ones that consumer chips miss.

## How to Use This Information

If Allelio identifies a pharmacogenomic variant, here's how to approach it responsibly.

**Don't change your medications.** This cannot be stressed enough. Do not stop, start, or adjust any medication based on Allelio results alone. Medication changes should only be made under the guidance of a prescribing healthcare provider.

**Mention it to your doctor or pharmacist.** If you're starting a new medication and you know you carry a relevant variant, share that information with your prescriber. They can decide whether confirmatory testing is warranted.

**Consider clinical pharmacogenomic testing.** Several companies and healthcare systems now offer comprehensive pharmacogenomic panels. These tests are specifically designed and validated for clinical use, and the results come with expert interpretation.

**Keep it in perspective.** Pharmacogenomics is one factor among many that influence drug response. Your age, weight, kidney and liver function, other medications, diet, and the specific condition being treated all matter. A genetic variant that suggests you're a "poor metabolizer" doesn't automatically mean a drug won't work — it means your doctor should be aware of the possibility.

## The Future of Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics is one of the most tangible examples of "precision medicine" — tailoring treatment to individual patients based on their biology. The field is growing rapidly.

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) has published guidelines for over 25 gene-drug pairs, and the FDA lists pharmacogenomic information on the labels of hundreds of medications. More hospitals and health systems are integrating pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing into clinical care.

In the future, it's likely that pharmacogenomic testing will be routine — done once, stored in your medical record, and consulted every time a new medication is prescribed. Until then, tools like Allelio can give you a preliminary look at your pharmacogenomic profile, helping you start informed conversations with your healthcare providers.
