# Allelio — Landing Page Structure & Copy

---

## Section 1: Hero

**Headline:**
Your DNA, Your Computer, Your Privacy.

**Subheadline:**
Allelio is a free, open-source tool that analyzes your raw genetic data entirely on your own machine. No uploads. No cloud. No one else sees your genome.

**CTA Button:**

## Section 2: The Problem

**Headline:**
Your genetic data is deeply personal. Why send it to a stranger's server?

**Copy:**
Most genetic analysis tools require you to upload your raw DNA file to a remote server. You're trusting a company you've never met with the most intimate data you own — your entire genome. Some sell it. Some get breached. Some just quietly share it with "research partners."

Allelio takes a different approach. Everything runs locally on your computer. Your data never leaves your machine. Not even for a moment.

---

## Section 3: How It Works

**Headline:**
From raw file to plain-English insights in minutes.

**Step 1 — Drop in your file**
Export your raw data from 23andMe, AncestryDNA, or any service that provides a VCF file. Drag it into Allelio.

**Step 2 — Allelio cross-references your variants**
Your genetic variants are matched against ClinVar (clinical significance) and the GWAS Catalog (research associations) — two of the most comprehensive public genomics databases in the world. All of this happens locally, using a database stored on your machine.

**Step 3 — A local AI explains what it finds**
Allelio uses a local large language model (via Ollama) to generate plain-English explanations of your results. The AI runs on your hardware. Nothing is sent to OpenAI, Google, or anyone else.

**Step 4 — Review your report**
Browse your results by category — health conditions, traits, pharmacogenomics, carrier status — in a clean web interface or a standalone HTML report you can save and revisit.

## Section 4: Features

**Headline:**
Built for clarity, privacy, and control.

- **100% Local Processing** — Your genome never touches the internet. Analysis, AI, and reporting all happen on your machine.

- **ClinVar + GWAS Catalog** — Cross-references millions of clinically annotated variants and thousands of genome-wide association studies.

- **AI-Powered Explanations** — A local LLM translates complex genetics into language anyone can understand, with lifestyle context and research citations.

- **Multiple Format Support** — Works with 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and standard VCF files out of the box.

- **Web UI + CLI** — A clean browser-based interface for everyone, plus a command-line tool for power users.

- **Configurable Analysis** — Filter by traits only, adjust how many variants get AI explanations, choose your preferred local model.

- **Open Source (MIT)** — Fully transparent. Read every line of code. Fork it. Improve it. It's yours.

## Section 5: What You'll See

**Headline:**
Real insights, clearly organized.

**Copy:**
Allelio categorizes your findings into sections that make sense:

**Health Conditions** — Variants with known clinical significance from ClinVar, including pathogenic and likely pathogenic findings.

**Risk Factors** — Genetic associations with elevated risk for certain conditions, drawn from large-scale research studies.

**Traits** — Non-medical characteristics like caffeine metabolism, lactose tolerance, eye color genetics, and more.

**Pharmacogenomics** — How your genes may affect your response to specific medications.

**Carrier Status** — Recessive variants you carry that could be relevant for family planning.

Each finding includes the variant ID, gene, your genotype, source database, and — when AI is enabled — a plain-language explanation with context.

## Section 6: Privacy by Design

**Headline:**
We didn't just add privacy. We started with it.

**Copy:**
Allelio has no server. There is no account to create, no data to upload, and no analytics tracking your usage. The tool runs entirely as a local application on your computer.

The reference databases (ClinVar and GWAS Catalog) are downloaded once from their official public sources (NCBI and EBI) and stored locally. After that initial download, Allelio doesn't need an internet connection at all.

If you enable AI explanations, those are generated by a local language model running on your own hardware through Ollama. No API keys. No cloud inference. Your genetic data stays in your RAM and never hits a network socket.

---

## Section 7: Getting Started

**Headline:**
Up and running in under five minutes.

**Step 1: Install Allelio**
```
pip install allelio
```

**Step 2: Download reference databases (one-time)**
```
allelio setup
```

**Step 3: Install Ollama for AI explanations (optional)**
Download Ollama from ollama.com, then pull a model:
```
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

**Step 4: Analyze your data**
```
allelio analyze your_genome.txt
```

Or launch the web interface:
```
allelio serve
```

## Section 8: Who It's For

**Headline:**
Whether you're curious or clinical, Allelio meets you where you are.

**For the curious** — You got your 23andMe results and want to understand what's actually in your raw data, beyond the polished consumer reports.

**For developers and bioinformaticians** — You want a hackable, open-source foundation to build on. MIT licensed, clean Python, well-structured codebase.

**For privacy advocates** — You believe genetic data is too sensitive to trust to any third party. Allelio proves that local-first genomics tools are not only possible but practical.

**For educators and students** — A transparent tool for learning how variant annotation and genetic risk assessment actually work under the hood.

---

## Section 9: Open Source

**Headline:**
Transparent by default.

**Copy:**
Allelio is released under the MIT License. The entire codebase is available on GitHub. You can read exactly how your data is processed, how variants are matched, how the AI prompts are constructed, and how safety disclaimers are applied.

We believe tools that handle genetic data should be auditable. No black boxes. No proprietary algorithms hiding behind a paywall. Just clean, readable code doing exactly what it says.

Contributions are welcome.

## Section 10: Disclaimers

**Headline:**
Important information about this tool.

**Primary Disclaimer:**
Allelio is an educational and informational tool. It is **not** a medical device, diagnostic instrument, or clinical decision-support system. The results produced by Allelio should **never** be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, genetic counseling, or clinical genetic testing.

**On accuracy:**
Allelio cross-references your genetic variants against publicly available databases (ClinVar and the GWAS Catalog). These databases are maintained by research institutions and are regularly updated, but they are not infallible. Variant classifications can change over time as new research emerges. Association studies (GWAS) report statistical correlations, not causation, and most associations involve small effect sizes that are not individually predictive.

**On AI-generated explanations:**
When AI explanations are enabled, they are generated by a local large language model. Language models can produce inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information. AI explanations are provided for convenience and general context only. They do not constitute medical interpretation.

**On clinical decisions:**
If Allelio identifies a variant classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, this does **not** mean you have or will develop the associated condition. Clinical genetic testing performed in a certified laboratory, interpreted by a qualified genetic counselor or medical geneticist, is the only appropriate basis for medical decisions.

**On high-impact findings:**
Certain genetic findings — particularly those involving cancer predisposition genes (such as BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and Lynch syndrome genes) or neurodegenerative risk factors (such as APOE) — can carry significant emotional and medical weight. If Allelio flags variants in these genes, we strongly recommend speaking with a certified genetic counselor before drawing any conclusions.

**On data privacy:**
While Allelio processes all data locally and never transmits genetic information over a network, users are responsible for the security of their own devices. Allelio does not encrypt stored database files or analysis results. If you are concerned about local data security, take appropriate precautions with your file system and device access.

**On liability:**
Allelio is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors and contributors of Allelio accept no liability for any decisions made or actions taken based on the information this tool provides.
